I was holding off on this to give it more thought, but I think it's come together enough for me to put out there for public scrutiny. I like to come up with different ways of viewing the world to better describe it. I'll get into the depth of this topic in a future post, but here I'm going to layout my theory on the Elements and Their Aspects. This is a way of looking at competition that I think sheds light on all of the important points in an interesting way. Please do contact me with any feelings or critiques you have. I hope to mold this into something very useful over time.

The 4 Elements: Water, Shadow, Fire, and Soul

The 4 elements are the 4 main categories of aspects. They all deal with a certain area of competition, while their aspects delve more specifically into the details of that area.

Water - The neutral, it dances and flows. This is the area where no one has really committed yet, or where competitors come back to after an exchange.

Shadow - The hidden and deception, it hides in everything. This is the element of secrets, hidden information, and deception. While some many aspects deal directly with the shadow, it is a part of everything.

Fire - Offensive, direct, and raging. This is the element of direct action. Where everything is plain to see.

Soul - The self. This element deals with one's internal strengths outside of the context of an opponent.

Water Aspects: Deer, Goat, and Dog

Deer - Carefulness and distance. The deer constantly tries to be safe and keep a good distance between it and its opponent.

Goat - Bold and offensive. The goat leaves the water behind and charges into the fire. It ends the neutral by forcing an engagement.

Dog - Watching and attentive. The dog watches the water and gathers information. It carefully learns about its opponent and its environment to know when to back off and when to strike.

Shadow Aspects: Fox, Monkey, Spider, Dragon

Fox - The trickster. The fox uses jank, gimmicks, cheese, and whatever else you call it. It pokes fun at its opponent by doing what it's not supposed to.

Monkey - Hyper active and always moving. The monkey constantly jumps around from one situation to the next, confusing its opponent by fogging up the situation, never letting information be clear.

Spider - The trapper. The spider lays carefully spun webs for its opponent to fall into.

Dragon - The aspect of intuition. The dragon just knows. It knows when to strike and when to run. It does the unthinkable because at the moment, it is the right choice.

Fire Aspects: Ox, Wasp, Badger, Kraken, Human, and Yeti

Ox - The powerhouse. The ox plows through its opponent with sheer power.

Wasp - The unyielding stinger. The wasp uses quick small attacks to pester and eventually overwhelm its opponent.

Badger - The brave, or the stupid. The badger does not care for its own well being and attacks wildly without abandon.

Kraken - The maelstrom. The kraken uses vortexes, offensive situations that lead back into themselves, to constantly whittle down its opponent.

Human - The judge. The human punishes, that is takes gauranteed advantage and damage from mistakes, all errors, forced or unforced.

Yeti - The snowball. The yeti uses its advantage to gain greater advantage, to gain greater yet advantage, constantly, until is an overwhelming force of advantage that cannot be dealt with.

Soul Aspects: Raven, Lion, Viper, Hawk, Cat

Raven - The keeper of knowledge. The raven knows as much as possible about the game its playing.

Lion - The regal. The lion keeps its dignity and composure throughout any kind of stress and anxiety.

Viper - The quick. The viper reacts to any change and any information as soon as possible.

Hawk - The all seeing. The hawk sees the battlefield as a whole. It sees the forest and the trees.

Cat - The precise. The cat moves with precision and has complete physical control over itself.

These aspects describe people, situations, and actions in competition. For example, someone who has impeccable aim and great execution is highly channeling the cat. Someone who constantly plays keep away and refuses to engange is channeling the deer. These don't have to be exclusive, though. A powerful offensive tool that is very dangerous when defended against properly channels the dragon, for the intuition needed for its proper use, the ox, for its sheer power, and the badger, for its high risk and necessary bravery to use.

This will hopefully make sense more as I use this framework of elements and aspects in my future writings. I like it as a shorthand and kind of universal language in all competitive endeavors.
