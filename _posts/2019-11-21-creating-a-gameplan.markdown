Welcome to the beginning of my beginner's guides. I'm starting with the basics of creating a gameplan, as I think that is one of the most under served areas of beginner guides in fighting games, let alone Soulcalibur. I'm generally assuming that if you're reading this, you understand frame data, but if not don't worry. I'll be going over that, too, eventually, and it will be linked HERE when available. I'm also assuming you understand basic concepts like what a high is and what throw breaks are. (anything in parentheses are either longer form notes to explain some nuance, or very academic language for those who want it, you can always skip it) So let's get to it.

I want to build a gameplan, so where do I start? Well, what's the goal. To make a plan you need a goal! The goal is to win, but how do I do that? Either do enough damage, or ring them out. Ok, we have a goal now! We have actually have two, though, and that can get messy, so I'll be focusing on just the damage goal for now. As most players will tell you, anyway, ring outs aren't exactly something you aim for and more an opportunity you take when it's available. It gets way more complicated than that as you get higher and higher level, but for now let's keep it basic! We have a goal, and it's to do enough, 240, damage. (Oh, and don't lose. That's bad.)

So how do we do damage, let alone 240? We hit them with moves! Then how do we do enough damage? Use good moves! (Academically put, we want to use the best moves available to us to maximize damage potential) What are good moves? I think this here is actually the wrong question, at least when trying to figure things out. Finding good moves is hard, but finding bad moves is easy. So, what are bad moves? There are two kinds of bad moves. Moves that don't do enough damage, and moves that get beat out by other "things." Damage is so easy to look at to the point where I probably don't even need to tell you about it. 70 is better than 20. 10 is better than 5. You get the idea. But how do moves get beat out? Well, ignoring frames for now (to again, keep things simple, but also to avoid the kind of hyperfocus on frame data that can happen a lot), there are three ways to beat out a move, dodging, blocking, and parrying. Let's break these down.

<ul>Dodging Options:
<li>Duck</li>
<li>Jump</li>
<li>Sidestep</li>
<li>Backstep</li>
</ul>

<ul>Blocking Options:
<li>Standing Block</li>
<li>Crouching Block</li>
</ul>

<ul>Parrying Options:
<li>Guard Impact (GI)</li>
<li>Reversal Edge (RE)</li>
<li>Auto Guard Impact (auto GI)</li>
<li>(for simplicity's sake, I'm ignoring things like Reverse Impact and Soul Charge for now)</li>
</ul>

So what are the strengths and weaknesses of these options? Let's list what they beat and lose to.

<ul>Duck
<li>Beats: Highs</li>
<li>Loses to: Mids, Lows</li>
</ul>

<ul>Jump
<li>Beats: Lows, Throws</li>
<li>Loses to: Mids, Highs</li>
</ul>

<ul>Sidestep
<li>Beats: Verticals</li>
<li>Loses to: Horizontals</li>
</ul>

<ul>Backstep
<li>Beats: Short Range Moves</li>
<li>Loses to: Long Range Moves</li>
</ul>

<ul>Standing Block
<li>Beats: Highs, Mids</li>
<li>Loses to: Throws, Lows</li>
</ul>

<ul>Crouching Block
<li>Beats: Lows, Throws, Highs</li>
<li>Loses to: Mids</li>
</ul>

<ul>Guard Impact
<li>Beats: Normal Moves (in a certain temporal range)</li>
<li>Loses to: Guard Breaks, Patience, (moves outside the set temporal range)</li>
</ul>

<ul>Reversal Edge
<li>Beats: Normal Moves</li>
<li>Loses to: Guard Breaks, Sidestep, Outlasting Moves (this can get complicated)</li>
</ul>

<ul>Auto Guard Impact
<li>Beats: Depends on the move</li>
<li>Loses to: Guard Breaks, Moves that it doesn't parry</li>
</ul>

Alright so that's a bit of a list, but if you're reading this, it's probably full of info you already know. If you didn't already know it, don't worry to much. These are all of the basic options laid out for you to see, so feel free to come back here for reference. I do all the time.

With that out of the way, here's a basic gameplan, free of charge. 90% of the cast will be able to use this gameplan with no issue, and this is where every single one of my gameplans starts.

<ul>The Basic Gameplan
<li>AA - Beats sidestep and jump</li>
<li>BB - Beats duck, jump, backstep, and crouching block</li>
<li>Throws - Beats sidestep and standing block</li>
<li>A+B - Beats duck, jump, crouching block, guard impact, reversal edge, and auto GI (also soft beats standing block)</li>
<li>2K - Beats standing block and duck</li>
</ul>

Quick note, you might notice that throws and 2K are kind of redundant. I originally just had throws, but I realized that not everyone's BB hits someone on the ground, so 2K hits stubborn people who refuse to get up after a throw. It also is a nice tool in case you're up against a guessing (blue)god who constantly breaks all of your throws perfectly.

This basic gameplan is literally all you need to win a match. It's not particularly good at it, but it is feature complete with no holes. This is the bedrock that every other gameplan will be built upon, going forward. So that's the bare bones of what you need to know. Next time I'll go over building a gameplan for a specific character.
