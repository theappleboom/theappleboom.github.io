I haven't been as consistent as I wanted, so I'm sorry for that. This whole pandemic thing really has everyone all over the place, huh? Well I'm putting it down here now that I hope to have a post a day every day next week. They just might not be as long as I usually go. I also am going to start branching out to topics other than Soulcalibur. I feel like there's only so much I can write about it before I start really getting into the kind of hyper detail that barely anyone will read. Unless you're into that kind of detail, in which case, hit me up on any social to say that you do want me to write about that stuff.

As for now, my personal journey has been really hampered by not being able to understand what other people are doing in a match. It's weird, because I feel like it's specifically Soulcalibur where I struggle with this. I remember back in Pokken, when I took it seriously at least, I had such a read on people that I could win 3-7 match ups quite easily. Man, Gardevoir was bad in that game... I'm probably over thinking things, but I get really confused really easily. Hopefully I'll have some insight into how to get over that if I ever figure it out myself.

I'll see you all on Monday!
