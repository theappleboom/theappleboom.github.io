Alright, time for theory and stuff. I'm not going to be able to go into too many specifics since this is the fundamental idea behind creating a gameplan for any character, but don't worry. I'll be posting examples soon enough. The main idea, though, is to exploit your character's strengths and shore up their weaknesses by molding the basic gameplan into something much more useful. (The best gameplan for a character is one that properly adjusts the basic gameplan to maximize damage and ring out potential given that character's move list.)

First you need to find out what your character wants to do. Some are more obvious than others, and no character only wants to do just one thing. Amy wants to get roses and then win by being a better character. Astaroth wants to grab you. Mitsurugi wants to scream URYA! So how do we find out what a character wants to do? This question is best tackled from multiple perspectives at once, but do know, answering this question is the SINGLE HARDEST THING to do in the game (theory wise). Even at the top level, well performing players can have wildly different opinions of what characters really want to do, so don't sweat it if you get it wrong. You will definitely get it wrong at some point, so just chalk it up to experience and move on.

So what are the ways to find out what a character wants to do? Maybe look at their unique mechanics, like Amy's roses. What moves and combos do the most damage? What moves and combos leave you at the best advantage? What are their safest options? I personally look at their safest options, and then start whittling down the possible choices by considering damage and unique mechanics and such.

Once you come to some good enough answer for what a character wants to do, how do you do it? This is where supplementary moves come in. These moves cover up the weaknesses of your main moves and help open up your opponent to get hit by your main moves. To take the basic gameplan as an example, the most damaging (outside of throws, they're inconsistent) move, and therefore your main move, is BB. What will BB hit? BB hits ducking, jumping, crouch blocking, and maybe back stepping. What will BB lose to? BB loses hard to side stepping and loses softly to standing block. How do we get our opponent to get hit by BB and not beat BB? AA, throws, and 2K. These beat side stepping, and lose hard to ducking or crouch blocking. By showing our opponent we are willing to use these moves, they will either respond accordingly and be opened up for BB, or they will stubbornly ignore our message and lose to the damage from AA, throws, and 2K.

As you remove moves from your gameplan, make sure that your bases are still covered. You don't want to accidentally end up with a gameplan of all verticals and nothing to counter side step! Whenever you're at a point where you think your gameplan is solid, make sure to go back to the [list of defensive options][guide-start] and check that everything is covered, and covered well. I cannot tell you how many times I've made a really complex gameplan just to realize that I can't do anything meaningful about them side stepping!

The most important thing to remember, though, is KISS! Keep It Simple Stupid! When you know they're going to sidestep, you can't afford to fumble around. Well, my A+B might hit, but 6A could hit, too, oh and I really like 4A, but 44A is safest... and now they've already side stepped and are launching me for half life since I just stood there. When the time comes, know what you're going to do! They're sidestepping, use AA! Done. This is why training mode drills and practice matches are so important, as well. Once you figure out your gameplan, make sure to practice using it a lot so that it's second nature once the time comes to really win!

Next time I'll be going over how to figure out match ups. It's probably going to be a shorter one, as the work is hard, but the concept is simple. See you there!
